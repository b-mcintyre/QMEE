#### Null Hypothesis ####

#1)	The observed increased variability of total area of wings within a genetic background is 
#not due to mutant alleles with moderate phenotypic effect but chance. 
#Test by permutation within a genetic background by interchanging either the mutant alleles or area measurements
#and seeing if there is still an observed change in variability

#2)	The observed decreased variability of total wing areas between wild type genetic backgrounds is not due to mutant
#alleles with strong or weak phenotypic effects and is due to chance.
#Test by permutation between wild type genetic backgrounds by interchanging the mutant alleles, area measurements, 
#or wild type genetic backgrounds and testing if the variability around the mean for each wild type background 
#remains the same for each group. 

# aspects of the data I would like to scramble include the predictors Allele_1 and WT background.
